# AIML CA2: Student Profiles Analysis

This project involves analyzing and transforming student profile data for a business scenario, focusing on data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to uncover key insights.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess student profile data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships in the dataset.
- Visualize key insights using advanced plotting techniques.

## Key Steps

### Data Cleaning
1. **Handling Missing and Inconsistent Data:**
   - Processed columns like `NATIONALITY`, `LOCAL`, `FOREIGN`, and `HIGHEST QUALIFICATION`.
   - Standardized date formats for `DOB`, `COMMENCEMENT DATE`, and `COMPLETION DATE`.
   
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Added new columns, such as `Age (at course completion)`, `COURSE NAME`, and `COURSE CODE`, for enhanced analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sunburst Chart:** Explored relationships between nationality, qualifications, and age distribution.
- **Grouped Bar Chart:** Examined the funding types for local and foreign students.

### Visualization Tools
- Utilized Plotly and Dash for interactive visualizations, making insights more accessible.

## Summary
This project provides a detailed workflow for cleaning and analyzing real-world student data. By transforming the raw dataset into a structured format and leveraging visualizations, it delivers actionable insights for improving program offerings and understanding student demographics.
